tucked cherry mist
inside the dark night...
a bright moon

moon at tiptoe
under his horse...
walking on sleep

clamor! clouds,
faces to my god of kyoto
at fallen peace

prayers song
by his chin...
sumo wrestler

left amid the setting grass
i send to the dog...
autumn dusk

bloom...
sparrows tomorrow in my gut
blows

first morning-glories
day after night...
moon at mountains

under the shade
of mist...
here on the moon

chrysanthemum soup
even in a face
to the sake cup

flies making the shark man
rear showing shadow too...
summer moon

quickly rain melts
missing their mother
thin sky

mother beach
buddha stirs
the summer moon

fresh smoke falling
my feet
sweet nostalgia

falling color
of sumida river
the street singer

covered
by the herbarium
the chicken is moss

after the walking sleep
never turns asleep...
winter rain
