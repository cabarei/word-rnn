    spindrift . . .
    I go where
    the story takes me





    drifting snowflakes
    the police car’s ascent
    up our driveway





    evening breeze
    through the barnboards
    final bid





    our easy silence
    every puddle
    sky-deep





    wedding invitations
    the press and release
    of the nib





    paddling through stars
    the wake of a boat
    long passed





    pride parade
    from behind a cloud
    the sun comes out





    stone cairns
    a faded cap drifts
    downriver



    sand dunes
    by morning
    a different dream



    early morning
    mist reunites
    the hills


    the underside of leaves
    her back story
    changes everything


    snow crocus
    my grandson asks
    if I have dreams



    county fair
    second place ribbon
    in an empty stall



    junk car
    the hum of bees
    beneath the hood








    a bit of rust
    on the Chevy's fender
    harvest moon





    that time of year
    moonlight fills
    his empty chair



    birding . . .
    the unfamiliar path
    home



    winter solstice
    the tilt
    of her hospital bed



    first morning
    firecracker papers
    wander the streets





    flies wait it out
    under a cow’s chin
    spring shower





    heartwood
    the saw changes
    its tune





    snow field
    the earth marked
    by fallen angels





    setting sun
    an accordion squeezes
    the night air



    no moon
    the click of stilettos
    on cobblestones



    flowing estuary
    native languages
    long gone



    in the hot tub
    my eyes on her floating breasts
    Hunters Moon



    rosebud unfolding
    the seed packet left behind
    in Revelations




    no escaping
    this moonlight—
    Pompeii





    river mud
    the shape
    of boys





    desert twilight
    a map with many creases
    nailed to a cross



    we huddle
    over mother’s open grave—
    lawless winter



    a long bus ride
    the prophetic language
    of the stops


    Navajo moon
    the coyote call
    not a coyote





    deleting words
    from the eulogy
    falling leaves



    calla lily
    the sound of a ladder
    lengthening



    tasting the well
    in the water—
    summer stars


    Mother’s Day
    the expiration date
    on wildflower seeds


    northern lights . . .
    the scratchy play
    of seventy-eights


    summer passing
    the yard flamingo’s
    rusty legs 


    glint of sunlight:
    the respirator carries on
    alone

  	

    All Souls Day...
    my name called
    from the front gate



    autumn
    an empty booster seat
    in the barber's window



    hunter's cabin:
    of the woods
    not of it



    end of the walk
    returning the crow's feather
    where I found it



    cafe for sale—
    outdoor tables rusting
    into autumn



    day lilies
    another death date added
    to the family tree


    The house finch
    has a song for it,
    morning after snow



    crescent moon
    a bone carver sings
    to his ancestor




    close enough to touch—
    I let the junco lead me
    away from its nest




    Blowing leaves
    tempt the old cat,
    but not enough




    ancient mountains . . .
    runners clearing hurdles
    on the practice field



    Thanksgiving—
    fifteen minutes
    of mince pie




    blossoms . . .
    the baby’s bare feet
    pedal the air




    butterfly
    my attention
    attention span




    one moth
    a thousand candles
    light the darkness




    trail’s end—
    my pebble
    settles the cairn






    family reunion—
    some of the beached kelp
    in knots




    a jar of pennies
    on the lemonade stand
    evening cool




    lightning . . .
    the scarecrow's coat sleeve
    caught in mid-wave




    summer's end
    the hammock turned in
    on itself




    Charcoal Alley—
    children flick marbles
    into the light



    season of lights
    the postman
    leans to the wind


    having no thought
    we've come to see them—
    dogwoods in bloom


    turning tide—
    placing intact clams
    back in the water




    mallard pair
    he rocks
    on her wake




    filtering in
    with the night air
    a skunk's warning




    stone in my pocket—
    the brook cuts deeper
    into the mountain




    a bee chose
    the rose I meant to pluck . . .
    empty vase




    soba noodles . . .
    the new year
    slips in




    hazy dusk . . .
    no one bothered to plow
    the graveyard road








    child's wake
    the weight
    of rain





    a stick caught
    on the lip of the dam
    winter's end




    summer stars . . .
    the old violin goes
    to the highest bidder




    winter drags on . . .
    I squeeze the last drops
    from a teabag




    distant thunder—
    a titmouse gives one chirp
    and falls silent




    Alzheimer's birthday
    each slice of the cake
    takes part of her name




    March winds
    a decade has passed
    by your grave





    Indian summer
    a spent salmon
    washes ashore




    after the funeral
    whiskers still
    in his razor




    the page-finders
    of my father’s Daily Missal
    losing their colors




    first buds of spring
       I change the washer’s setting





    Among the gravestones
    with names worn away
    children play hide ‘n seek




    whalebone
    from a beach near Savoonga—
    winter rain




    All Saints morning
    a path
    of trodden leaves




    cremated
    in her favorite kimono—
    small green plums





    loon calls
    my daughter drawing circles
    near the fire




    summer evening—
    from across the meadow
    a call to supper




    shivering on the roof
    I rub my palms together
    meteor shower







    Humid July—
    from the stove the smell
    of old fires




    the wind of autumn
    a homeless man warms himself
    hand to mouth

  	
  	







    broken easel—
    the front yard blue
    with wildflowers




    heat waves—
    the hitchhiker shifts her child
    to the other hip




    land's end—
    sand in each bite
    of my apple




    Indian summer
    a fish slips through
    the gill net











       lethal injection
    unable to shut
    the blind dog's eyes









       Geronimo's grave
    someone has left
       plastic flowers






    new in town
    the scent
    of unknown flowers




    foghorns . . .
    we lower a kayak
    into the sound




    catalog time
    the garden begins
    without a seed




    new butterfly . . .
    folded wings
    lean into the wind




    morning overcast
    a few seeds still dangle
    from the dandelion




    break up
    I leave behind
    her butterfly net




    walking home barefoot,
    we enter the shadow
    of the hill




    autumn evening . . .
    a page of the old book
    separates from the spine







    funeral procession . . .
    snowflakes blowing
    into the headlights




    autumn evening
    my hospital window
    becomes a mirror




    storm clouds
    the cry of a shearwater
    circles the sky




    late into the night
    we talk of revelations
    moon through the pines





    winter beach
    a piece of driftwood
    charred at one end




    riveredge old growth:
    a towering window
    of stars

  	
  	







    Over the railroad tracks
    the slow motion
    of a snake




    The beetle I righted
    flies straight into
    a cobweb




    leaf in my palm
    its stem extends
    my lifeline




    about the tree
    over my small son's grave
    —tell me




    musty smell
    forgotten . . . deep
    into the text




    that Venus!
    leading the cupped moon
    through every turn of the road




    "grabs" and "opens"
    the fist
    sowing seeds


  	




    the river—
    coming to it with nothing
    in my hands








    summer solstice—
    the long tips of lavender
    bent by bees




    snowbound
    coloring inside
    the lines




    the dumproad pond
    tadpoles exit
    a birdhouse




    still sun-warmed . . .
    the pulled-out scarecrow
    in my arms




  	
  	





    letting the branch go
    a shower of petals falls
    on the old woman




    toll booth lit for Christmas
    from my hand to hers
    warm change




    winter seclusion
    tending all day
    the small fire




    on the path
    only one of us
    touched by a falling leaf




    winter, bedtime
       static flickers





    warm river—
    up to our necks
    in sunset




    beneath the ice
    the waterfall


  	[Top]
  	
  	





    Old garden chair
    sagging with the weight
    of a single leaf.




    after the stroke. . .
    watching only the half of your face
    that smiles




    City window
    mountains and pines
    etched in frost




    Autumn deepens
    an empty snail shell
    explored by an ant






    snowflakes
    no one will miss
    melt in her hand





    learning too late
    he didn't like bubinga wood—
    sun strikes the urn




    the war memorial—
    migrating butterflies
    cover the names




    falling leaves
    the house comes
    out of the wood




    leaving you—
    fog on either side
    of the white heron




    Below zero
    all curled up in the woodpile
    the skin of a snake


  	





    August morning—
    a window washer wiping dust
    from his sunglasses



    sunlight shines red
    through my father's thumb
    on the steering wheel






    Approaching the family plot . . .
    my furled umbrella
    turns into a cane.




    Chernobyl victim—
    fingers pressing the plastic
    to his wife's caress






    The thick clang
    of a cowbell
    the sun deepens




    Roses
    in the smaller room
    more fragrant






    dry leaves
    the old archer
    curves his eyebrow




    soft rain—
    the new grave
    looks old




    morning sneeze—
    the guitar in the corner
    resonates




    dusk
    a lone car going the same way
    as the river



  	
  	





    so many ways
    within the waterfall
    for water to fall




    after the rain
    on my vegetable patch
    a new crop of stones




    frozen in mud
    by the vacant shanty:
    lottery ticket




    the potter's hands
    gently shape the vase





    Watermelon rind,
    sitting in its own juice
    the summer sun




    figure drawing class—
    in the model's deepest shadows
    a stark white string





    watching rain
    pouring down . . . pouring down
    just watching









    taking time . . .
    listening
    to the grocery clerk




    in the Yukon
    sleeping with one eye shut
    the summer night




    in soap bubbles
    again and again
    his face is broken

  	
  	





    yard sale,
    sunlight filling
    mason jars




    leaving home . . .
    the smell of smoke
    from old brick chimneys




    frozen pond—
    white antlers rise
    through the ice




    June night
    my mother alone with
    her cancer



    phoning the neighbors
    their real voices
    through the open window




    repeating the lecture
    his eyes following
    the window-cleaner's blade




    Tools rusting
    Unused on the work bench
    A faucet dripping





    dusk
    drawing the pond's depth
    to the surface




    old woman, wrapping
    her cat's gifts
    —centering the bows




    on the way to work
    a hot air balloon
    up in the mist


  	



    second husband
    painting the fence
    the same green




    such coolness
    the snail stretches
    its neck




    the one legged bird
    that deep bend before
    taking off




    bird song
    lost
    in bird song






    in the sea
    the fireworks
    rising










    early spring sun—
    the spinster combs out her hair
    for nesting birds









    My father's hammer
    warm again
    in my hand



  	





    migrating geese—
    once there was so much
    to say




    sound of her voice
    carrying eggs
    across the ice




    moving
    with the clock tower's shadow
    the flower lady

  	[Top]
  	
  	





    heart drawn in dust
    by the old Indian . . .
    rain




    mist
    lifting
    the loon's cry




    snowman's eye
    sinking in
    the spring rain




    Autumn afternoon:
    I stand on the shadow
    of the sparrow




    ten below zero:
    man and boy walk through their breath
    to read old tombstones




    hot wind
    the roadrunner's beak
    opens and closes




    Blackbirds descend
    through the floaters
    in this eye




    the old man
    closes the shadow
    in his hand




    spring drizzle
    rounding the thorn
    a drop of light




    deserted wharf
    the mime bows
    to the moon




    a spider's web
    across the windharp
    the silence


    horns fold
    at my shadow's touch;
    brown slug


    dead mynah bird . . .
    with each passing car
    its wing flaps



    blackened walnut
    left unopened—
    winter solstice




    Distant woodchopper
    inside the cabin
    axbite echoes




    checking for water
    the woman finds a full moon
    trapped in the cistern



    Old woman,
    rain in the eye
    of her needle




    The path shorter now,
    underfoot the crumbling leaves;
    the child runs ahead





    cold morning sea—
    an old man towels
    himself in the sunlight




    fields of corn stretching
    as far as the eye can see
    within






    and yet
    perishable is flesh—
    a mountain plum




    what thing cries out
    deep inside us
    cooking the turtle?




    Lights out
    the firefly
    inside




    the wind
    somewhere else
    bird tracks in a light snow




    apples cooking:
    in the aroma
    pictures of my mother canning

  	





    the child
    points at the moon
    and says, "bird"




    one seagull
    on a shaft of air;
    dawn




    Lean man
    Carving
    The tree's dream.





    from behind me
    the shadow of the ticket-taker
    comes down the aisle





    Part of a dog
    walking by upside down
    in the roadside puddle




    Where the ripple was
    the fisherman casts his line;
    another ripple




    Quiet strokes
    of night swimmer: the slap
    of beaver tails . . .




    never expecting
    the lilies in November
    nor the small coffin






    The way of the conch—
    blueing in the sea, and
    echoing in the wind


  	






    reaching into sky
    the girl breaks the wish—
    bone of geese






    still lake—
    a hawk makes off
    with its image




    skiers!
    standing
    on the wind
