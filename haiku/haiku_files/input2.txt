In the lantern light 
White are the tea plant blossoms 
By the path at night.


A little village here 
Is sleeping, lulled by crickets 
Chirping sweet and clear.



Oh, how small, my sweet, 
Is your painted parasol 
In this intense heat!


In the twilight gloom 
Of the redwood and the pine 
Some wisterias bloom.


Oh, how quietly 
And how still the heavy snow 
Fades into the sea!


Soothed by the serene
Balminess of spring, I fell
Asleep on the green.


Spring hills disappear
Sinking into the pine grove
As I wander near.



Some one from below
Is looking at the whirling
Of the cherry snow.



Through the pampas grass
That sways and dances gently
In the breeze, I pass.



Piercing crimson red 
Is the autumn setting sun 
On the cockscomb head!



“Chestnut gatherers?”
They inquired in return 
When we asked the way.



The snows are falling; 
And far into the distance 
Meiji has gone.



Deep within the dale 
Wrapped in veils of evening mist, 
Sings the nightingale.



In the morn I go 
Stepping over the bamboo 
Broken by the snow.



Night begins to come, 
And the darkness falls at once 
In the grove of plum.



The dancing rings become
Larger and larger to the beat
Of the quickening drum.



With a rustling sound
Fallen leaves pursue and pass
Others on the ground.



Brushing the leaves, fell
A white camellia blossom
Into the dark well.



Luminous and cool
Is the way a pebble sinks
Iuto the blue pool.





Shadows from the hills 
Lengthen half across a field 
Of gold daffodils.



Tenderly again 
On the peony I hear 
Whispers of the rain.



Cast by morning light, 
The stamen’s shadow is black 
On the calla white.



A lizard flicks over 
The undulating ripples 
Of sunlit clover.



In moonlight, half-hid 
By the silhouettes of leaves 
Twits the katydid.



A crimson dragonfly, 
As it lights, sways together 
With a leaf of rye.



A crimson dragonfly, 
Glancing the water, casts rings 
As it passes by.



Flowered is her hem, 
Ankle-deep in daffodils 
As she gathers them.



Here at parting now, 
Let me speak by breaking 
A lilac from the bough.



The shadow of the trees 
Almost reaches to my desk 
With the summer breeze.



I drink—listening 
To the sound of the water 
Rising from the spring.



Hurriedly runs rain 
Toward the sunlit grain field, 
Half across the plain.





Against the black sky 
The lightning paints the great oak 
As it flashes by.



Under the low grey 
Winter skies water pushes 
Water on its way.



Underneath the eaves 
A blooming large hydrangea 
Overbrims its leaves.



Broken, broken, yet 
Perfect is the harvest moon 
In the rivulet.



White swans, one or two, 
Drew near, pushing the water 
For the food I threw.



With the mattock I 
Dig the garden where the cloud’s 
Shadow passes by.



Moving in one big sway 
The flowering winter peony 
Scatters bright and gay.




On the bench I wait 
For the second gust to come 
Through the garden gate
