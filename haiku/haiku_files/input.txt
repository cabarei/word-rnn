amish territory

long beards longer
black clothes darker
under july sun

amish gentleman's
warm smile brief . . .
my skirt long and plain

an amish grin
as he cycles past
the station selling gas

the gloom within
a handcrafts store . . .
dolls with missing faces

facing mirrors
long-skirted woman
and her amish child

music on the wind
an amish foot softly taps
and abruptly stops

late night camp . . .
now a gentle lullaby
horse hooves heading home

Frogpond XIV:1
Cor van den Heuvel
the billboard’s shadow
a haiku/senryu sequence

late autumn
the billboard's shadow leans
into the woods

from the stream
two mallards fly straight up
through falling leaves

new year's eve blizzard—
a neon beer-sign glows
behind the steamed window

spring breeze
the woods road is still wet
under the pines

the old watering can
hangs one more rainbow
among the roses

the evening paper
on the darkening lawn—
first star

a letter stuck
in the 11th floor mail chute—
summer night

the blues singer
tells how bad it is
then the sax tells you too

quiet afternoon—
in the meadow, one daisy
leans on another

at the end of a tunnel in the clouds
a sunlit billow

crossing the tracks
at twilight—
the autumn wind

chilly sunrise
a strip of bark flutters
on the lake-side birch

twiddling my thumbs
the sun goes down,
the moon comes up

winter drizzle—
unloading a crate of live ducks
behind the chinatown restaurant

snow melts by the hardware counter—
the squares of color
in the paint catalog

in the mirrors on her dress
little pieces of my
self

a few blocks
from the street festival—
the evening quiet

at the pow-wow—
they pass out ordinary saltines
for the ceremony

while his passengers sleep,
the bus driver watches dawn
break

by the lawn's edge,
the dog barks at the darkness
then looks back at me

dead end—
a few leaves circle
in the headlights

late at night—
a woman alone in the restaurant
addressing christmas cards

snowy morning
the barber appears
in his mirrors

moonrise
the columbine still
swinging

changing pitchers—
the base-runner looks up
at a passing cloud

in the subway
the young conductor cues
imaginary oboes

climbing the stairs
more slowly—
autumn evening

the frozen puddle—
kids slide over a pattern
of red leaves

snow drifts
above the bear's den
starry night

cold spring rain—
a piece of grass sticks out of the birdhouse

Earth Day: Variations with Theme

sundawn

mapletree buds,
their small shadows

white lilac
fragrantly exuberant
beside the porchdeck

putting down a book
to listen to the god
in the half-cleared brook
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

high noon
straight-up trunks of poplars shadowless
a foreshadowing ... soon, soon?
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

watching a program
on Brazil’s rain forests,
anger poisons calm
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

on the grass
two pitched-from-a-car beer cans.
unthinking ass!
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

a cardinal's song
blends with the brilliant sunset.
surely, nothing's wrong?
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

cicadas at dusk—
seventeen years hence, shall we see
substance or husk?
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

in moonlight
swish of owl wings, this heartstab:
glitter can gloss blight
                                           nearby, a bell tolls changes

Return to the Wall
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Washington, DC

removing her wedding ring
she brushes ¡t along
her husband's name
son of an MIA
the flag pin on his lapel
upside-down

woman touches a name
while looking at
an old photo

elderly couple
their faces reflected
over their son's name

man in a filthy army jacket
tries to scratch on
his name

a candle
left burning on the ground
its flame almost out

Note: "The Wall," born of the author’s first impressions of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, appeared in the November 1988 issue of Frogpond.

How many dew drops make up these walls?

On razor wire
squats a crow—
winter night

The guards in their towers:
silk worms in cocoons of light

Black-uniformed winter fly
greeting me
behind bullet-proof glass

Walls of ice
      deep in forests
            frozen frogponds

My silver shackles—
gossamer threads
under these stars

Old guard escorting me
       coughing like bullfrog
             cigarette smoke for breath

Prison cat in shadows
stalking the shaft of searchlight

Capturing snowflake fireflies with my tongue

Beating time with nightstick,
cricket sound
while I urinate

Oh, winter moon,
what have you done now
keep-locked with the mountains?

A thousand temple bells—
the noise of the cell block

Suddenly they all look like green bullfrogs!

Decorating my cell again
     I notice roommate—
         a silverfish on my pillow

From out of Henderson’s Haiku,
     my old wife’s photograph:
           cells doors automatically locking.

Abandoned Farmhouse

abandoned farmhouse:
bird nest in the mail box
also deserted

abandoned farmhouse:
wallpaper peeling back to
my childhood

abandoned farmhouse:
something scratching
inside the furnace

abandoned farmhouse:
the quiet bedroom where I
feared the dark

abandoned farmhouse: a
yellowed grocery list taped

abandoned farmhouse: a

abandoned farmhouse:

New Orleans Wedding

here & there
in bare treetops
mistletoe

in a shabby motel
all night
treefrogs in rain

cottonmouths
in the swamp ...
a house on stilts

**

family get-together
all the eyes all the feelers
all the hands tearing shrimp

morning in the French Quarter
café au lait &
beignets      with sparrows

the river wind blows
into the Quarter
& through his saxophone

on the riverfront
a stranger
takes my smile

the breeze
off the Mississippi
fills my skirt

behind grillwork
down darkness to sun
in a hidden courtyard

cool the alley
through the grillwork swirls
cat pee smell

in the morning shops
half the doorways
fill with shade

all the Mardi Gras colors
in the masks
in the houses

on the iron lace balconies
only flowers
sunning

from the suite dusk
fills in the river
& all the tiny lights are slow

**

huge limbs of the live oak
their reaching out
over the young grass

     in a pecan grove
wandering spring shadows
     cows & blackbirds

parked on the runway
its wings drooped     a B-52
the winter sun

the slow day ...
in the empty motel corridor
a stack of dirty dishes

sundown in the empty bar
the player-piano keys
begin

the big waitress departs
the china teapot
shakes

January sun ...
the cotton fields
dotted with leftovers

Records of a Well-Polished Satchel: #6 Angles of Loneliness

what passion
you had, Akiko—
where can I put
even an inch
of tonight's anguish!

sucking
chocolate squares—
oh, it's a lonely beginning
this first night of return
to Japan

under this Basholess
pre-dawn sky
how rough
the angle of loneliness
along this eastern sea

bent
like a puzzle
in a child's hand,
that back before me
in the pre-dawn dark

is it a walking
umbrella?
immense the black
over that bent-against-the-wind
angle of loneliness

a crane
skipping before me
on this seaside road,
its leg
a karate lift?

I hug
the boy to me—
how brave he was to point and say
This is a pencil
This is a cup

on my office couch
I lean back,
back,
this Nescafe's
the length of my desire

in this bare
late-afternoon life
I make
my bare dinner
and set out fork and knife

wanting
to embrace
even a sleeve—
tonight's
lonely angle

Flashes of Sunset . . . All the Way Home
Flashes of sunset
between the cars
the eastbound freight
   
old railroad tracks
bobbing sunflowers surround
the turquoise outhouse   
violet aster
still bright
behind me    
in blue-black ocean night
the ferry's churning white wake
fades in the distance   Gita Bodner
after her phonecall
following wet footprints
back to the bath   
hikers at dusk
spilling with shadows
out the canyon mouth   
high country
feeling the forest
hidden in the dark   
sleeping in his bed
—a dream
of her grandson's return  Richard Bodner
Honolulu airport
breathing wet warm air
sniffs of unknown flowers    
road to Ooty:

wrestling on the edge
of the State Fisheries tank
—two soaked monkeys    
sunrise didj at Ulsoor Lake
dobi-wallahs slap
their morning loads on stone   
mountain hotspring
snowflakes sink in
the rising steam  Gus Bodner
waking my daughter
frost-flowers on the window
from her breath    
driving to meet our son
—nighthawks fly
before the storm cloud   
past the plane's great wing
a strip of thin grass shimmers
in the jet wind    
wet pavement
the smell of sage
all the way home  Virginia Bodner

Six Ways of Seeing Summer Rain

I
A red shaft of light
dances on your moist eyelids:
the searing morning.

II
Frog Mountain rises
to arch its back in the clouds:
unforeseen downpour.

III
Three men and three birds
stand still in the forest, all
surprised by rain.

IV
Rain like the Deluge:
a mudspattered Apache
sings in Cibecue.

V
The day hides itself
within a grove of aspen.
Thunder pursues it.

VI
Uprooted clouds:
Summer holds the pale mountains,
calls down the clear night.

Beachfront Suicide: Reflections at Dusk

Gunshot!
The tide of gulls breaks
like a scattering wave

Gathering silence
in my mind is
the hardest thing to do

Against the wind's chill
I button my sweater
feet dug in sand

The sun slips low
a carnelian red paving
the water with dark light

How many wanderers
have followed the sun
down?

(The girl with the soul
of a gull
never came back)

Questions
purl like schools of fish
in dangerous waters

Questions
without breath without answers
a broken shell

Wintering Over: New York Haiku

From the fire escape
    the cry of the mourning dove
          wintering over

New condominium
    its exhaust grate claimed by
         a new derelict

Wind chill minus five
     the piercing whistles
           of the starlings

The young mother
     stoops to warm the child's mittens
           between her gloves

Between lace curtains
     the white cat's eyes
          follow a snowflake

A crow flies down
     to land in the new snow
          its voice ringing

Madison Avenue
     a row of ginkgoes mulched
          with old Xmas trees

Suet on a string
      suspended from a snowy branch
            three sparrows make it spin

In the shadow of

Shohomish County Jail Haiku
For Karol

Under cloudless skies;
nuclear resister jailed
   missiles free to fly

    April sun slanting
across the exercise yard
      jail-bar shadows

        Basketball stops
     in the exercise yard—
convicts shoot the breeze

               This heat!
snow-clad mountains framed
      by my jail cell window

          Little ladybug
caught after visiting hours:
    doing jail time, too

   Starting a new month
in Snohomish County Jail;
      same old tea bag

Chilly June morning—
    in a spider web
the jailhouse fly hangs

Sixty day jail term—
as it grows shorter
my growing beard

Walking Home on a Summer Afternoon

summer afternoon—
the priest takes a blue pencil
from the blind man

coming up through
a gap in the city bridge. .
a checkerspot butterfly

backfire—
a checkerspot in its sound
shifts direction

dog coming out
with the cathedral crowd. .
tail upward

half way home
pole shadows reach across
the widening road

train whistle—
two jets wrap the sky
with mist

a block from home
a pair of rain drops find
my haiku notes

Revenant

suddenly—
twenty years later
you taste the same

through two marriages
framed behind Beethoven
your picture

talking with him
I taste you
in the tea you serve

on your porch
only the breeze
moves between us

in the dark car
the scent of you
and the rainy fields

juice from the apple
runs into my beard
as I wait for you

in the mirror
the only picture
of us together

your perfume—
looking up startled
at a stranger

in the cold fireplace
my last letter
burning

2017 Bernard Lionel Einbond Award for Renku
Honorable Mention:
From the Vine

by

Polona Oblak, Ljubljana, Slovenia
John Stevenson (coordinator), Nassau, NY

cloudless sky
the warmth of tomatoes
straight from the vine

    stretching the batik pattern
    of a well-worn hammock

my cousin
shows me a few grips
on his guitar

    the ticket stub serves
    as a book marker

silhouettes
of totem poles
against the rising moon

    lonely for you on longer nights
    of this Northern Hemisphere

regretting her marriage
whenever she hears
the wild geese call

    who knows what “Brexit”
    will really mean in ten years?

the dentist suggests
a surgical extraction
of wisdom teeth

    new tamping machines
    for the cemetery

    a sprinkle
    of brown sugar melting
    over oatmeal

the moon reveals
a pack of hunting wolves

    still paranoid
    even though the weed
    is now legal

an incomplete entry
in Captain Nemo’s log

    young lovers
    unable to keep their hands
    to themselves

I’ll never dance again
to our song!

    hard rains
    reviving
    a mountain stream

a train accelerates
through greening fields

    cherry petals
    on the soles
    of a row of shoes

the laughter of children
popping soap bubbles

Judges' Commentary for 2017:

        We are pleased to award Grand Prize in the 2017 competition to Glacial Boulder, a summer kasen renku. During our many readings of the entries, this poem drew us back more than any other. The opening hokku is steeped in traditional imagery and is a fine start for this winning entry. Several other desirable qualities should be noted: the variety and unexpectedness of the stanzas; the clarity of language; the overall freshness; and the satisfaction in discovering the links between stanzas. Some links are more subtle than others, and studying and solving their small mysteries was fun (and educational). Moving from candied apples / as party favors (the sixth stanza in the jo) into the ha presents an easily realized, delightful link and shift.

        The variety in the types of linking is a major asset. There’s always a place for humour and the amusing linking between class clown / the butt of a joke (stanza 20) and her stage fright / she takes it all off / for a steamy scene is a treat. Also notable is powerful imagery between the stubble field / stretching the long / rays of sunlight and town park cannon / quiet for generations at the beginning of the kyu. The lively verse, brindled colts / canter into the meadow, brings the renku to a satisfying close.

        •

        From the Vine, a summer nijuin renku, held our attention for Honorable Mention. Again, we enjoyed the types of linking. One of the most interesting links was found between the dentist suggests / a surgical extraction / of wisdom teeth to new tamping machines / for the cemetery—the mind boggles. There is a wonderful flow of diverse imagery in the opening section that moves from warm tomatoes under a cloudless sky to a well-worn hammock and on to grips on a guitar, to finish with a ticket stub as a book marker. We appreciated the intriguing shifts, the inclusion of current events, and the interesting transition from the end of the middle section to the fast close of the last four stanzas.
