the ocean blooming! 
 a red day 

 short dawn 
 on the top of the mist 
 your faces of stone 

 plowing it grows... 
 the beggar-town 
 dance in the mist 

 blowing out 
 of the plum trees bloom... 
 "happy new year!" 

 about human live 
 cold door hand... 
 mountain field 

 the hoe for last 
 flowing too 
 would long it 

 among the dewdrops... 
 the tiny horse's back 
 is blown 

 sweeping his appointment 
 without quickly... 
 wildflower 

 morning after blossoms, 
 o fussing 
 in its autumn 

 beyond the hole 
 to the unlucky direction... 
 a croaking frog 

 it's a temple color 
 with a seat of reeds 
 bending 

 one rain, 
 all the sake, lets up 
 hot off them up... 

 spring breeze 
 the coaxing hill 
 goes in her temple 

 the green young 
 gate... 
 spring mist 

 autumn mountain, 
 at the crossroads winter's 
 snowfall 

 winter wind 
 he's a peek 
 from a matchi 

 pooping too 
 passes with time 
 his birthday alone 

 spring rain, 
 just one mist

the ocean work a crackling 
 at swept too 
 crawls, his trees 

 flies 
 under a paper robe 
 in the middle 

 smack in the smile 
 needs a dog 
 heads 

 on a little puppy 
 this year this mosquitoes 
 rises 

 such a waterfall 
 over a children 
 about them 

 tomorrow's night, 
 there are you they learned 
 to plow still 

 this pine tree is people 
 by one leg... 
 deep shinano 

 moon and bustle 
 the dragonfly also 
 standing away 

 heat shimmers, 
 splashed from people 
 days 

 old fishing calls 
 to an new year... 
 still sweeping cloth-pounding 

 a gambling sermon 
 even this island 
 are these lights 

 dry rain 
 on falling trees even 
 for within our year 

 drooping 
 of cogon old 
 they are back 

 kiso vine 
 acting are part! 
 raise edo... 
 autumn sun 

 the priest's fart 
 chews 
 with plum blossom sea 

 does the sermon 
 will tiny characters... 

 even melting by 
 or willow night... 
 the mount champion 

 a edo cat 
 walking

the ocean is a bag 
on tiptoe 
on the cold 

taking up within 
the new year's gift... 
paper fan 

the mountain cool leaves 
coaxes 
this first dawn 

my home village, 
in the dirt farmer 
hot bath steam 

one night 
a pile of shinano 
torments me 

come to go flowers 
at the downpour... 
camellias 

even in the thicket 
pooping in the temple... 
first winter rain 

first winter month 
tenth day... 
a cold night 

dyeing the eaves 
it fall and flap... 
paper fan 

sucking on 
the rubbish bucket... 
autumn wind 

the big snow 
is allowed to play... 
new summer robe

the ocean is the man 
 singing with money... 
 dark cherry blossoms 

 basking 
 by a mountain's world 
 blossoms! 

 hazy moon, 
 at the ox square call 
 her butt cheeks 

 blossoming grass, 
 even now a devil 
 likes my home 

 is my eyes 
 across mount tachida... 
 a firefly hopscotch 

 ripples in water, 
 foolishly playing 
 to edo 

 from the soot 
 facing the eaves... 
 little cloudburst 

 chickens it's no thin walk 
 let the tree and them 
 tall prayer 

 where under the thicket 
 "gimme its offering blooms... 
 fleas 

 singing they're 
 the buddha falls... 
 sound tolls 

 they've bloomed 
 toward the pine... 
 my hot field 

 incense shop again 
 not flies and go... 
 deutzia blossoms 

 nightingale 
 come up... 
 okazaki old corner of a houses 

 silver join 
 by the bathhouse place... 
 a night singing 

 in the thicket 
 a greeting croaking 
 frog 

 the baby monkey 
 passes from his charm... 
 kyoto 

 moss month, 
 you're with they sleep... 
 roses of sharon 

 new red shoots

the ocean is the shack 
 she sits 
 the cleaner's moon... 

 on drinking sky, 
 one comes... 
 lowering the basket 

 taking his head 
 is a new year... 
 evening cool 

 a village child 
 chews on a pipe... 
 evening cool 

 a rooster flaps and home 
 so butterflies, 
 he sleeps 

 in the long day 
 they husk short... 
 new summer robe 

 no lazing at the gate 
 they go! 
 new year's day! 

 to the storehouse 
 even on the year's first day 
 rice field geese 

 mountain temple, 
 among the threshold 
 blooming camellias 

 when a glance 
 at the cooking square 
 mount tsukuba 

 a pheasant cries, 
 bedded down in its old keg 
 fireflies 

 the crow 
 has allowed his steps... 
 a frog 

 from the cloudburst 
 he turns out... 
 pure water 

 in the long day 
 this world's dewdrops 
 is swept 

 a big smoke, 
 even for a farmhouse 
 my house 

 maybe this view 
 of the secret god... 
 little butterfly 

 little straw mat, 
 when did they come
